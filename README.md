## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.

The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## Finding of the research

A thorough investigation of the U.S. Census Bureau data rendered into a beautiful scatter chart that can be viewed at [this web page](https://kyraha.github.io/UMN_HW16_D3-challenge/).
